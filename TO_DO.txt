			TO DO LIST:


1. Verify creation of log.txt, and attachment to email. Debug in the event that files are being created

2. Incorporate spinners for instrument names, instrument ID, procedure names, shifts

3. Remove generic methods, test methods, test data, test variables.

4. Investigate maintenance log message. Hardcoded 3 causing crash of app. Message commented out to test.(this was for debugging so it is fine)
